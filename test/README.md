# Testing for SignalControl

This directory contains a set of test files for the SignalControl Arduino library.
It is an ad-hoc test framework to support unit tests and compile time testing
of the example sketches.
It is provided to make it easier to develop the library without having to
upload the code to an actual Arduino unit.

This test framework is provided as is. 
Please contact me (sven@rosvall.ie) if you are interested in learning more about it.
